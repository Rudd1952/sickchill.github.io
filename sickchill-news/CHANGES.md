### 2016.04.27-1

[full changelog](https://github.com/SickChill/SickChill/compare/2016.04.17-2...2016.04.27-1)

* Refactor FilterBadReleases to filter_bad_releases, and adjust the logic:
    **Show specific required/ignored words now totally override global settings if they are set**

    If show ignored words are not set, global ignored words will be used
    If show required words are not set, global required will be used

    If the show has required words, they will be removed from the overall calculated ignored list when evaluating
    If the show has ignored words, they will be removed from the overall calculated rquired words list when evaluating

    If a show has required words which are also in the global ignored words they will override the global ignored and the release will be accepted
    If a show has ignored words which are also in the global required words they will overrid the global required and the release will be discared

    Release must not contain ANY of the final ignored words list, and at least ONE of the final calculated required words.

    Added a unit test to make sure this behavior is as expected and remains that way
